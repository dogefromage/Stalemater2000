# Stalemater2000
## A basic c++ chess engine

This project was inspired by [Sebastian Lague's Chess Engine](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-AI).
Stalemater2000 uses bitboards and alpha-beta search to quickly find the best move of a chess position. The program runs in a terminal and is controlled using commands from the [UCI protocol](https://www.shredderchess.com/chess-features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html). This way, the program can (try to) compete against commercial engines like Stockfish using [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/).

The bitboard logic I used was really well explained in [this Youtube series by Logic Crazy Chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_2-LOvr5E8&list=PLQV5mozTHmacMeRzJCW_8K3qw2miYqd0c).

Also, everything you'd ever would want to know about chess programming can be found on the [chess programming wiki](www.chessprogramming.org).
