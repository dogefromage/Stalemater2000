# Stalemater2000
## A basic c++ chess engine

This project was heavily inspired by [Sebastian Lague's Chess Engine](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-AI).
Stalemater2000 uses bitboards and alpha-beta search to quickly find the best move of a chess position. The program runs in a terminal and is controlled using commands from the [UCI protocol](https://www.shredderchess.com/chess-features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html). Therefore, the program can automatically compete against commercial engines like Stockfish using the [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/).
